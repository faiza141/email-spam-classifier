# Project Overview:
This project involves building an email spam detection system using logistic regression. The model classifies emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on their content features.

#Key Features:

Model: Logistic Regression

Performance: Achieved 96% accuracy, demonstrating strong classification ability.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

#Highlights:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization)

Model training, cross-validation, and performance evaluation

Confusion matrix and precision-recall analysis

Clean, reproducible notebook for full workflow

#Objective:

The goal was to develop a reliable, lightweight spam filtering model using classic machine learning techniques and basic NLP preprocessing.
